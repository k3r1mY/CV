  <h3><strong>My Hobbies</strong></h3>
  <p>One of my main hobbies is playing the guitar and hope to gain qualifications in music in the future before composing my own music.
    I also like to play computer games and watch movies or read books in my spare time as I feel these hobbies teach me a lot
    about other aspects of life and gives me the freedom to think and interpret things around me in different ways. <br>
    In terms of sports, I believe a fit body contributes to a fit mind and when time permits, I also go to the gym four to five times a week and usually play football once a week as well.</p>
  <h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
  <p>I attended the 19 Mayis TMK school for middle and high school education and did Physics, Maths and Turkish A-Levels for which achieved 2 C's and a B. I also have IGCSE qualifications.<br>
    I then began studying at the Eastern Mediterranean University which is where I am currently studying in my 3rd year. </p>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater">Dream Theater</a> - Incredibly complex rhythm, melody and timing all together. Each member of this group is undeniably a genius in their own measure. In my eyes, John Petrucci is the
      standout and easily one of my guitar idols.</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven">Ludwig Van Beethoven</a> - To most, he is the greatest composer of all time. I find almost all of his music to be effortlessley thought-provoking, forcing your mind to question
      things from all perspectives.
