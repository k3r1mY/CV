  <h3><strong>My Hobbies</strong></h3>
  <p>One of my primary passions is playing the guitar, and I aspire to acquire qualifications in music in the future. My ultimate goal is to compose my own music and explore the depths of musical expression. Playing the guitar brings me immense joy and allows me to tap into my creativity.

    In addition to music, I find pleasure in playing computer games, watching movies, and reading books during my leisure time. These hobbies provide me with valuable insights into various aspects of life and offer me the freedom to perceive and interpret the world around me in unique and diverse ways.
    
    Recognizing the importance of physical well-being for mental agility, I firmly believe in maintaining a healthy body to nurture a healthy mind. Consequently, I dedicate myself to regular exercise by visiting the gym four to five times a week. Furthermore, I engage in a weekly game of football, which not only enhances my physical fitness but also adds an enjoyable social element to my routine.
    
    By pursuing a combination of artistic expression, intellectual stimulation, and physical fitness, I strive to lead a well-rounded and fulfilling life.</p>
  <h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
  <p>I completed my middle and high school education at 19 Mayis TMK School, where I focused on Physics, Maths, and Turkish A-Levels. I achieved satisfactory results with 2 C's and a B in these subjects. Additionally, I obtained IGCSE qualifications.

    Following my secondary education, I enrolled at Eastern Mediterranean University, where I am currently in my 4th year of studies.</p>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater">Dream Theater</a> - Incredibly complex rhythm, melody and timing all together. Each member of this group is undeniably a genius in their own measure. In my eyes, John Petrucci is the
      standout and easily one of my guitar idols.</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven">Ludwig Van Beethoven</a> - To most, he is the greatest composer of all time. I find almost all of his music to be effortlessley thought-provoking, forcing your mind to question
      things from all perspectives.
